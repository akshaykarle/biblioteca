ThoughtWorks University TWU29:

Week 1:
Requirements for assignment 1:
The customer should see a welcome when they start the application.
A customer should have a list of menu options at the start of the application.
A customer should be able to select a menu option.
A customer should be notified if they do not select a valid option with “Select a valid option!!”
A customer should be able to view all books the library has.
A customer should be able to reserve a book for collection.
A customer should be notified if their selected book was reserved successfully with “Thank You! Enjoy the book.”
A customer should be notified if their selected book is not available with “Sorry we don't have that book yet.”
A customer should be able to check their library number and be notified with “Please talk to Librarian. Thank you.”

Week 2:
Requirement 1:
As a user of the application, I would like to be able to open the application, be presented with a new menu item which
will let me view the movie name, director and its rating.

The library will have 15 movies, which are pre-rated for popularity. People who use the application need the ability to
list the movie names and the ratings. We only need to see the movie name, the director and the rating.

The rating needs to be on a 1 – 10 scale, but can be represented visually however you want. We don’t need to worry about
how the pre-rating happened. Some movies might be very new and may not have a pre-rating. In this case, show the movie
name and explicitly show the user that this movie is not rated. This is equivalent to ‘N/A’.

So the user should see this:
Movie	Year	Director	    Rating
Sholay	1975	Ramesh Sippy	N/A
